                I am a recent graduate from York University with a double major in Experimental (Mathematical) Physics and
                Economics. I am also a graduate of the unique 1 year graduate program from

                This year, I was honored to be a guest speaker at Mcgill's CSCDS Data Science Expo<a href="https://www.cscds.ca/news/from-courses-to-careers-fsam9"> (My Page)</a>. 
                My talk revolved around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSmyRzNLxD0&t=904s"> BUILDING WEB APPLICATIONS IN THE REAL WORLD</a>.

                I have also been heavily influence from greek life. I spent my entire undergraduate career involved in fundraising and philanthropy operations for the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity.

                In 2016, I worked as a lab assistant in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at York University alongside at the time lab technician Nikolaos Balaskas. I was responsible for coordinating labs experiments for PHYS 1410. Also behind the scenes, I had helped the department with higher level experiments such as exploring the nonlinear pattern formation of Faraday Waves and emmision spectras for The Fourier Transform Spectroscopy.

                In 2018, I had completed a graduate project which aimed to analyze the quantitative factors that contribute to a successful kickstarter program. This was supervised under <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/dsl/people/boigraphies_postdocs/Tamer-Abdou/">Phd. Tamer Abdou</a> The project aimed to explore the difficulties on the financial spectrum of entrepreurialship. This project makes use of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms in R.

                <br>
                I also lead a project tasked with performing an exploratory analysis followed with Machine Learning in order to predict future churners and prevent them. This project makes use of the open source ML program <a href='https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/'> Weka</a> created by the University of Waikato - New Zealand. This project was supervised by <a href="https://mcmastercce.ca/instructor/218/karim-souidi"> Karim Souidi</a>
